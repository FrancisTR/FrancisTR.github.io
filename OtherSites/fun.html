                I am passionate in creating games. Before taking the Game Design course during my Junior year, I self-taught on using
                the Godot engine and exploring what the engine has to offer. Not only I got a grasp on the concepts of using Godot, but it
                prepared me to be successful in the Game Design class since I was able to transfer my skills onto learning a new game engine, which was Gamemaker.

                Fast forward to my Senior year, I have co-hosted a Game Jam event for the University of St. Thomas. I was responsible
                for creating the event using itch.io and advertising the event to the Computer Science, Digital Media Arts, and English department.
                Although there were a lot of tasks that weighed on me, I was able to manage both as a co-host and participant and our team
                was able to create a quality game under one week. Link to the official St. Thomas Game Jam below.

                Also in my free time, I enjoy playing video games either individually or with my friends. 
                I like to explore different ways to achieve goals of any size in a short amount of time. 
                This applies to any game from the likes of Animal Crossing: New Horizons to Super Mario Maker 2. 
                Playing video games has allowed me to hone my problem-solving skills over time as I continue to play new games and explore the different possibilities that they offer.
