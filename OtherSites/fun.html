                In my free time I enjoy playing video games either individually or with my friends. 
                I like to explore different ways to achieve goals of any size in a short amount of time. 
                This applies to any game from the likes of Animal Crossing: New Horizons to Super Mario Maker 2. 
                Playing video games has allowed me to hone my problem-solving skills over time as I continue to play new games and explore the different possibilities that they offer.
